When you develop a Backend Service in Rust there is great support with the _axum_ crate. What I stumbled upon was the question how can I write a Backend system in Rust that is observable.

This lead me to some journey because I did not really concern myself too much with Observability. This is mostly done with instrumentation by Operations in the Java World.

In Rust of course you cannot change the compiled program anymore.

So I wanted to share things I learned here.

Here we are only talking about observability as tracing. No metrics so far. although this may be a next topic.
