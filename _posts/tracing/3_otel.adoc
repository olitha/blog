== OpenTelemetry


OpenTelemetry (OTel) is a Spec and Framework for Distributed tracing, metrics, logs.

We only consider the tracing part here.

What does this mean? The OTel Spec defines the parts of the SDK independently of the implementation language. You can find the Tracing SDK https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/sdk[here]

The advantage is therefore that the concepts and implementations in the different programming
programming languages should not differ significantly. This considerably reduces the effort for the developer.

The OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for communication with the tracing backend is also defined.
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp[here]

The OTLP definition enables backends to understand all traces sent by an OTel implementation.


== OTel in Rust

First it may be hard to find your way around the OTel Implementation although it isn't.


=== The crates

OTel Implementation is separated in multiple crates. 
The parts are congruent to the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel[OTel Spec].

It is important to understand that the tracing crate has nothing to do with OTel. It is concerned about spans and events.

The following is supposed to give an overview over the components that are important for us.

=== Connecting Tracing Crate to OTel

As we have seen tracing is not aware of how the traces are logged out or where they are written to.

To bridge this the https://docs.rs/tracing-opentelemetry/latest/tracing_opentelemetry/index.html[tracing_opentelemetry] crate is available.
The crates provides a tracing layer that can be added to a subscriber like we did with the Fmt Layer before.

All this talking boils then down to this code
[source,rust]
----
 let telemetry = tracing_opentelemetry::layer().with_tracer(tracer_provider.clone().tracer("app tracer"));
    
tracing_subscriber::registry()
  .with(telemetry)
  .init();
----

We get an OTel Tracer from the OTel TracerProvider and set it in the Tracing OpenTelemetryLayer.
It is important to keep these things separate. The OpenTelemetryLayer is a tracing Layer whereas the TracerProvider and Tracer are coming from OTel.
