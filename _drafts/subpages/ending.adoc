== Wrap Up

For me this was a good journey. First a little bit bumpy because tower and all these trait bounds...
Hard to digest. But we got a little bit into it and now have a start to discover this even more and
get more fluent with it.

The challenge for me (and you had it too, because we're in that together) was to understand better how
the generic types of tower services are stacked together. But now I think we can write our own services.
Still probably pillow-fight the compiler but still manage it in the end.
