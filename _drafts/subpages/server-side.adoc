== Usage on Server Side
Just a few words about the server side. There is widespread documentation about it.

- https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/middleware/index.html[in Axum docs about middleware]
- https://hyper.rs/guides/1/server/middleware/[in Hyper Guides]

They all integrate fine with tower services. For example hyper Server https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/server/conn/http1/struct.Builder.html#method.serve_connection[serve_connection] accepts a Hyper Service. But if you have to adapt a tower service for it you can use the solution described in the guide above. 

Axum states
[quote]
[...] what sets axum apart from other frameworks. axum doesnâ€™t have its own middleware system but instead uses tower::Service.

Therefore for Server usage there is plenty of information.
