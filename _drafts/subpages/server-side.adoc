== Usage on Server Side
As there is widespread documentation about using tower on the server side just a few words about it.

.Documentation
- https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/middleware/index.html[in Axum docs about middleware]
- https://hyper.rs/guides/1/server/middleware/[in Hyper Guides]

They all integrate fine with tower services. For example hyper Server https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/server/conn/http1/struct.Builder.html#method.serve_connection[serve_connection] accepts a HyperService. But if you have to adapt a tower service for it you can use the solution described in the guide above. 

For Axum they state

[...] what sets axum apart from other frameworks. axum doesnâ€™t have its own middleware system but instead uses tower::Service.

Therefore for Server usage there is plenty of information.
